Approach

Initially started with the most basic of all classifiers - Naive Bayes Clasifier.
Further, used multiple classifiers to identify the best results among them.
Result : Random Foresr Classifier with n_estimators as 500.
Then worked for better feature extraction.
Tried LDA and PCA before identifying PCA as a superior algorithm.
PCA with 15 components covered around 61.2%.
Achieved a satisfactory score before Kaggle crashed.

Results

33.6% score on Kaggle.
